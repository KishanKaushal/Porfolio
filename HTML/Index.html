      <h1>The Basics of Machine Learning</h1>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that
        focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based
        on data. It's a powerful tool that enables computers to learn from
        experience without being explicitly programmed.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts in Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>Here are some fundamental concepts that you should know:</p>

      <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
      <p>
        In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning
        that the data includes both the input and the desired output. The goal
        is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Predicting house prices based on features
          like size, location, and number of rooms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
      <p>
        In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on data without labeled
        responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and structure from the
        data.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Grouping customers into segments based on
          purchasing behavior.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
      <p>
        In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and
        learns to take actions that maximize cumulative rewards.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Teaching a robot to navigate a maze by
          rewarding it for reaching the goal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Machine Learning is used in various fields to solve complex problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Image and Speech Recognition</li>
        <li>Recommendation Systems</li>
        <li>Autonomous Vehicles</li>
        <li>Medical Diagnosis</li>
      </ul>
